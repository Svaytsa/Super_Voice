# Verification Report

## Scope & Inputs
- Reviewed the "Master Plan" workstreams covering build system, protocol, client, server, docker, tests, observability, and docs to align verification with documented scope and dependencies.【F:docs/plan/00_master_plan.md†L1-L44】
- Cross-referenced protocol expectations for little-endian encoding and CRC tooling from the protocol work breakdown.【F:docs/plan/protocol_common/work_breakdown.md†L1-L28】
- Used client work breakdown notes to interpret queue capacity, retry limits, chunk sizing, and system-channel requirements.【F:docs/plan/client/work_breakdown.md†L30-L69】
- Consulted the observability plan for throughput and metrics objectives (≥30 MB/s with ≥4 sockets).【F:docs/plan/observability.md†L5-L23】

## Requirement Checks

### 1. Core Protocol & Platform
| Requirement | Status | Evidence & Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRC validation implemented | ✅ | Server storage verifies header and payload CRC32 before persisting chunks, using an explicit CRC routine.【F:Server/src/storage.hpp†L83-L149】【F:Server/src/storage.hpp†L226-L263】 |
| Little-endian protocol framing | ❌ | Plan calls for LE helpers, but the client serialises headers as newline-delimited text and the server parses them as strings rather than LE fields.【F:docs/plan/protocol_common/work_breakdown.md†L3-L18】【F:Client/src/sender.hpp†L171-L183】【F:Server/src/main.cpp†L285-L352】 |
| Production code (no stubs) | ✅ | Modules such as the directory watcher and bounded queue contain complete logic with no placeholder branches.【F:Client/src/watcher.hpp†L35-L97】【F:Client/src/queue.hpp†L10-L93】 |
| C++20 toolchain | ✅ | Top-level CMake enforces C++20 without compiler extensions.【F:CMakeLists.txt†L5-L7】 |
| Standalone Asio usage | ❌ | Build links header-only Asio but never defines `ASIO_STANDALONE`; sources include `<asio.hpp>` directly, risking Boost dependency issues.【F:CMakeLists.txt†L13-L24】【F:Client/src/sender.hpp†L1-L60】 |
| Zstandard placement | ❌ | Server assembler links against `libzstd` and performs decompression, contradicting the "client-only Zstd" constraint.【F:Server/src/assembler.hpp†L1-L148】 |
| Windows & Linux support | ❌ | Server storage/assembly depend on POSIX headers (`unistd.h`, `fcntl.h`, `sys/stat.h`), preventing Windows builds despite Windows scripting being present.【F:Server/src/assembler.hpp†L1-L148】【F:Server/src/storage.hpp†L1-L107】 |

### 2. Multi-channel Transport & Data Flow
| Requirement | Status | Evidence & Notes |
| Four system channels exposed | ✅ | Listener manager instantiates four fixed system acceptors (health, telemetry, control, ack).【F:Server/src/listeners.hpp†L21-L112】 |
| `X` data sockets scalable | ✅ | Same manager grows/shrinks the vector of data acceptors to match the requested count.【F:Server/src/listeners.hpp†L125-L150】 |
| Round-robin dispatch | ✅ | Client sender rotates through connections modulo the active size before sending each chunk.【F:Client/src/sender.hpp†L234-L308】 |
| Retry limit ≤ 3 | ❌ | Specification limits retries to three, but the CLI exposes `--max-send-retries` without an upper bound and the sender honours any value provided.【F:docs/plan/client/work_breakdown.md†L48-L57】【F:Client/src/main.cpp†L26-L118】【F:Client/src/sender.hpp†L195-L222】 |
| Queue capacity = 2048 | ❌ | Plan fixes the queue at 2048 entries, yet runtime defaults to 32 and capacity is user-configurable.【F:docs/plan/client/work_breakdown.md†L39-L46】【F:Client/src/main.cpp†L26-L110】【F:Client/src/queue.hpp†L10-L93】 |
| Chunk payload ≈ 2 500 000 bytes | ✅ | Default chunker payload size is 2 500 000 bytes and the chunker respects that boundary.【F:Client/src/main.cpp†L26-L33】【F:Client/src/chunker.hpp†L13-L44】 |
| `.part` staging + atomic rename | ✅ | Server assembles into `<name>.part`, fsyncs, then renames to the final path and removes patches.【F:Server/src/assembler.hpp†L48-L148】 |
| Zstd confined to client | ❌ | Client performs compression, but server also links and runs Zstd decompression, violating the "client-only" requirement.【F:Client/src/compressor.hpp†L1-L120】【F:Server/src/assembler.hpp†L57-L126】 |
| TTL parameter `N` with live updates | ✅ | Server exposes `--ttl`, stores the value, and control plane `SET_TTL` updates storage and runtime state immediately.【F:Server/src/main.cpp†L27-L104】【F:Server/src/control.hpp†L72-L116】 |
| CONTROL channel on-the-fly | ✅ | Control handler processes commands continuously over the socket loop without restart.【F:Server/src/control.hpp†L38-L116】 |

### 3. Docker, Tooling, and Throughput
| Requirement | Status | Evidence & Notes |
| Single Dockerfile building both roles | ✅ | Multi-stage Dockerfile produces server/client binaries and switches entrypoint by `ROLE`.【F:Dockerfile†L1-L46】 |
| Runtime scripts provided | ✅ | Bash helpers exist for launching server and client containers (Windows BAT variants also present).【F:scripts/run_server.sh†L1-L23】【F:scripts/run_client.sh†L1-L24】 |
| End-to-end harness | ✅ | `scripts/e2e.sh` builds the image, runs client/server containers, and validates checksum-integrity fixtures.【F:scripts/e2e.sh†L118-L258】 |
| Metrics capture ≥ 30 MB/s | ❌ | Observability target requires ≥30 MB/s with ≥4 sockets, yet the harness only exercises fixtures up to 2 MB, logs throughput without enforcing thresholds, and defaults to a single connection—no evidence of meeting the target is recorded.【F:docs/plan/observability.md†L5-L23】【F:scripts/e2e.sh†L128-L257】 |

### 4. Outcome Metrics Mapping
- No document or checklist named "OUTCOME METRICS" exists under `docs/plan/`; only the listed subdirectories are present, leaving the mapping unaddressed.【718dc4†L1-L1】

## Gap Summary
1. **Protocol framing deviates from LE binary spec** – newline-delimited headers bypass the shared `bytes.hpp` helpers, undermining the documented protocol contract.【F:docs/plan/protocol_common/work_breakdown.md†L3-L18】【F:Client/src/sender.hpp†L171-L183】
2. **Platform support and dependency expectations unmet** – missing `ASIO_STANDALONE`, POSIX-only filesystem calls, and server-side Zstd usage violate cross-platform and dependency constraints.【F:CMakeLists.txt†L13-L24】【F:Server/src/assembler.hpp†L1-L148】【F:Server/src/storage.hpp†L1-L107】
3. **Client-side pipeline sizing diverges from plan** – queue capacity and retry ceiling are configurable beyond the documented maxima, eroding bounded-backpressure guarantees.【F:docs/plan/client/work_breakdown.md†L39-L57】【F:Client/src/main.cpp†L26-L118】
4. **Throughput objectives unverified** – automation logs throughput but never proves ≥30 MB/s with four sockets or larger fixtures.【F:docs/plan/observability.md†L5-L23】【F:scripts/e2e.sh†L128-L257】
5. **Outcome metrics checklist missing** – repository lacks the expected OUTCOME METRICS documentation, so traceability cannot be confirmed.【718dc4†L1-L1】

## Recommendations
- Align client/server serialization with `common/protocol.hpp`, using LE helpers and binary headers to satisfy CRC coverage and interoperability expectations.
- Define `ASIO_STANDALONE` via CMake, audit POSIX calls behind platform guards, and remove server-side Zstd dependency if decompression must be offloaded to clients.
- Enforce queue capacity of 2048 and clamp retries at ≤3 within configuration parsing to honour the planned operating envelope.
- Extend `scripts/e2e.sh` (or add a dedicated benchmark) to run with ≥4 sockets against larger fixtures, asserting throughput ≥30 MB/s and capturing the measurement artifact.
- Add the missing OUTCOME METRICS document or section detailing how each target is validated to restore requirements traceability.
